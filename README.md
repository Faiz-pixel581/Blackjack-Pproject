# 🃏 Blackjack Game in Python

Welcome to a simple command-line Blackjack game made with Python! This is a beginner-friendly project where you play against a computer dealer by drawing cards from a virtual deck.

## 🎯 Game Objective

Get your cards as close to **21** as possible **without going over**. If your total is higher than the dealer's without busting, you win!

---

## 📜 Game Rules

- You start with **2 cards**.
- The dealer also starts with 2 cards, but only one is shown to you.
- Cards are worth their number. Face cards (J, Q, K) = 10. Ace (A) = 11.
- You can choose to:
  - `'hit'` to draw another card.
  - `'stand'` to hold your hand.
- The dealer must draw cards until their total is **17 or more**.
- Whoever is closer to 21 wins.
- Going over 21 is a **bust**, and you lose.

## 🛠 How It Works

- Uses Python’s built-in `random` module to simulate drawing cards.
- Simple conditionals and loops control the game flow.
- No external libraries needed.

## 🧠 Skills Used

- Python Basics: `lists`, `loops`, `functions`, `if-else` logic
- `random.choice()` to simulate card drawing
- Clean console interaction via `input()`
